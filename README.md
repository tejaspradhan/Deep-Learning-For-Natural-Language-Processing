# Deep-Learning-For-Natural-Language-Processing
This repository contains an exhaustive set of Deep Learning projects specifically applied to NLP problems like sentiment analysis. These projects have everything to get you started in the field of NLP and Deep Learning. The main framework used for these projects is Tensorflow. Each directory contains a separate project and hast its own readme file.
